## Notes
- Using Google Fonts: 'Outfit' (Display) and 'Inter' (Body) for a clean, modern tech aesthetic.
- Color palette: Strict monochrome (Black/White/Gray) with a subtle accent color (e.g., a deep tech blue or neon green for trending items, but sticking to the request's "subtle accents").
- Auth: Using `use-auth.ts` provided by the blueprint.
- Images: Using Unsplash for shoe placeholders until dynamic uploads are implemented.
